# COSC 404 - Database System Implementation<br/>Lab 6 - Storing JSON Documents: MongoDB and PostgreSQL

This lab practices using JSON data in both MongoDB and PostgreSQL.

## Using MongoDB (10 marks)

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) is a NoSQL system designed for large data sets with convenient support for storing JSON documents. MongoDB targets high performance, high availability, and scability.  It has a query API that is different than SQL and works with many common languages including Java.  This question asks you to load data into MongoDB, update a document, and perform queries using the Java query API for MongoDB.  Modify `QueryMongo.java` to perform the tasks and test with the JUnit test file `TestMongo.java`.

- +3 marks - Method `load()` to load data into the database.
- +2 marks - Method `update()` to update one document.
- +2 marks - Method `query1()` to perform basic query with filter and projection.
- +3 marks - Method `query2()` to perform query with OR and arrays.

## Using PostgreSQL with JSON Data (10 bonus marks)

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is also capable of storing JSON data and manipulating it using SQL. In this bonus question, modify `QueryPostgres.java` to perform the same insert of JSON data, update, and querying as done with MongoDB in question #1. The JUnit test file is `TestPostgres.java`.


- +3 marks - Method `load()` to load data into the database *using PreparedStatements*.
- +2 marks - Method `update()` to update one document.
- +2 marks - Method `query1()` to perform basic query with filter and projection.
- +3 marks - Method `query2()` to perform query with OR and arrays.

## Submission

The lab can be marked immediately by the professor or TA by showing the output of the JUnit tests and by a quick code review.  Submit the URL of your GitHub repository on Canvas. **Make sure to commit and push your updates to GitHub.**
